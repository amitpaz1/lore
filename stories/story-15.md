# Story 15: Launch Prep

**Batch:** 10 | **Dependencies:** Story 14

## Description
Write launch content: blog post, HN submission, and landing page copy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Blog post draft (markdown, ~800 words): "Why your AI agents keep making the same mistakes"
2. Blog post includes code examples showing before/after with Lore
3. HN "Show HN" post draft: title + comment body (concise, technical, honest)
4. Landing page copy: hero section, 3 key features, quickstart snippet, CTA
5. All copy reviewed for tone: technical, honest, not hype-y
6. Social media blurbs: 1x Twitter thread draft (5 tweets), 1x Reddit post draft
7. All content saved to `docs/launch/` directory

## Technical Notes
- HN audience: lead with the problem, not the solution. Be honest about limitations.
- Blog tone: "I built this because I had this problem" — personal, not corporate
- Landing page: can be a simple GitHub Pages site or just great README
